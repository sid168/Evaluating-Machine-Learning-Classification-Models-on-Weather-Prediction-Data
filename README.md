# Weather Data Classification with Python

## Overview

This project focuses on evaluating and comparing various classification algorithms for weather prediction. Using a dataset from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, we assess the performance of multiple machine learning models to predict rainfall. The goal is to determine which algorithm provides the most accurate and reliable predictions for weather forecasting.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and contains weather observations from 2008 to 2017. The dataset includes features such as temperature, rainfall, wind speed, and humidity. The primary target variable is `RainTomorrow`, which indicates whether it will rain the next day.
