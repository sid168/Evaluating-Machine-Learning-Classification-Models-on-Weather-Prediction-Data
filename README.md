# Evaluating-Machine-Learning-Classification-Models-on-Weather-Prediction-Data
This project involves evaluating various classification algorithms on a weather dataset to predict rainfall. Using Python, we apply and compare the performance of five machine learning modelsâ€”Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and SVM.
